Learning Goals

Figure out how to use CRC/Sequence Diagrams to plan/design code classes

Figure out how to test cookies

Figure out how to test API controllers

Figure out mocking/integration tests

Figure out the nuance behind testing that a route returns the correct html page
vs the route having a login form (it returns correct html page vs it allows user
to enter login attempt, i.e. testing for implementation vs testing for behavior?)

Figure out how to replace own implementation with libraries
such as passport.js and still maintain the tests (testing of 3rd party library integration)

Figure out how to write clean code (SOLID OOP, AOP)
